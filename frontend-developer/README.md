# Frontend Developer

## Overview

Part of the Waveform interview process is a coding exercise which aims to resemble some day-to-day techniques and skills
you will need in your role. You will be asked to complete a number of exercises at home, and we will then review those
exercises together as part of a subsequent interview. That interview will involve asking questions on why you made
certain decisions, and asking you for alternative solutions or extending the problem(s).

## Exercise detail

Contained in the `exercises` directory are 5 tasks we would like you to complete. There are 2 CSS-based tasks and 3
JavaScript-based tasks. We encourage you to write clean, well-formatted code, documented and tested where you think it
is appropriate.

We assume all of our prospective employees lead full and busy lives, and so we wish to take the minimum amount of your
time possible, while ensuring the role is a good fit for both you and us. This test is designed to take around 60
minutes, and while it is not a timed challenge there is no need to go above-and-beyond the requirements.

Here are the exercises:

* [Task 1 - Centered Box (CSS)](exercises/tast1.html)
* [Task 2 - Flexible Space (CSS)](exercises/tast2.html)
* Task 3 - (JS)
* Task 4 - (JS)
* Task 5 - (JS)

## How to submit your work

You can submit your answers either by via pushing your code to a new branch, or by sending the completed `exercises`
directory as a zip file by email.

Good luck!
